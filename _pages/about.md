**Short bio:** <br/> I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford, I have spent time at [NAVER AI](https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html) and [KAIST SILAB](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by Jinkyoo Park. I hold a Master's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from KAIST and a double Bachelor's in Control Theory and Automation Engineering from the University of Bologna and Tongji University. <br/>
I am originally from [Bologna, Italy](https://bolognauncovered.com/2016/12/25/tortellini-recipe-and-a-bit-of-tortellino-history/), but I have had the wonderful opportunity to spend ~20% of my current lifespan in Asia (several years in China, several more in South Korea).

**Research:** <br/> My work spans topics in deep learning, dynamical systems, variational inference and numerical methods. I am broadly interested in ensuring the successes achieved by deep learning methods in computer vision and natural language are extended to other engineering domains. 


To achieve this vision, my research follows **two fundamental principles**: <br/>
• High-quality ML software standards common in computer vision and natural language (including model heuristics and massively parallel training) should be exported and adapted to the requirements of other engineering areas. <br/>
• Domain expertise in the form of mathematical models and advanced numerical methods should be embedded in the learning model whenever possible, in order to guide other design decisions and ensure a satisfactory baseline performance.

I am a core maintainer and contributor to various open-source libraries for neural differential equations and numerical methods for neural networks.
